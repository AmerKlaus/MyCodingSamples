            <h3>My Personal Information:</h3>
            <p>
                My name is Amer Al Jawabra, I am turning 21 years old on the 25th of September, and I am Canadian who is
                originally from Syria. I am a student at
                <!-- Link to vanier college -->
                <a href="https://www.vaniercollege.qc.ca" target="_blank">Vanier College</a> in the Computer Science
                Technology program aspring to be a software engineer.
                I am a youngest child with two brother and one sister. Despite being originally from Syria,
                I was actually born and raised in United Arab Emirates, Al Ain. I moved to Canada when I was turning 14
                years old,
                due to UAE not giving residency or passports to non-locals.

            <h3>My Hobbies:</h3>
            <p class="para1">
                One thing I like to do in my free time is playing video games; I have spent a lot of time exploring all
                different kinds of games,
                which I had a lot of fun playing espically with friends. Another hobby is listening to music; I listen
                to
                music quite frequently,
                it helps me when I am stressed or bored. My favorite song has to be <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftujE679Wx0" target="_blank">Leaving Heaven</a>
                which was made by Eminem. My favorite line in the song is <i>"Cause life is like a penny, Cause it's
                    only
                    one percent Who overcome the stuff they've underwent"</i>.
                One more hobby I want to mention is playing soccer; I have loved playing this sport since I was a little
                kid
                and I have been playing it till now.
                I never stopped enjoying espically when I play it with friends!
            </p>
            <p class="para1">
                I also have hobbies that I would do in normal time like eating and making grilled cheese sandwiches, or
                when
                I randomly start beatboxing while working on something.
                I like working out and eating healthy; it makes me feel good about myself. One of my favorite exercises
                is
                doing push-ups or dips, because they give me a crazy chest pump.
                Another I enjoy doing is learning, specifically in fields I find fascinating like computer science,
                human
                biology/psychology, or anything I feel would be useful to me.
                I normally do not like reading and prefering watching things, unless I am researching about these topics
                then I read a lot.
